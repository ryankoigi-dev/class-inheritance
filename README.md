 This repository illustrates  the principles and practical applications of class inheritance in object-oriented programming. It contains example code, documentation, and tutorials illustrating how classes inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, enabling code reuse, extensibility, and hierarchical design patterns.
# Class Inheritance

Welcome to the **class-inheritance** repository!  
This project demonstrates the principles and practical applications of class inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) using clear examples and documentation.

## Overview

Class inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. This repository provides:

- Example code illustrating inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism.
- Tutorials explaining how inheritance works in popular programming languages.
- Documentation on best practices for using inheritance in software design.

## Features

- **Language-agnostic examples:** Explore inheritance in Python, Java, C++, and more.
- **Step-by-step tutorials:** Learn how to create base classes, derived classes, override methods, and use superclasses.
- **Best practices:** Understand when and how to use inheritance effectively to write maintainable and reusable code.
- **Visual diagrams:** Grasp inheritance relationships through UML diagrams and code visualizations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryankoigi-dev/class-inheritance.git
   ```
2. **Explore the examples:**  
   Browse the `examples/` directory for code samples in different languages.

3. **Read the documentation:**  
   Visit the `docs/` directory for in-depth explanations and guides.

## Example

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks
```
